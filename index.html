                              <hr>
                              <p>Everyone is familiar with the term "silence." Have you ever wondered what the term "silence" really meant? Everyone is welcome back! I'm the illogical and unworthy person of your precious time.
                                  <br><br>
                                  Have you ever paid attention to the silence around you? Have you ever considered the reason for the silence? According to human psychology, the silence that surrounds us is entirely dependent on the things that surround us. Will you accept it? When discussing silence, the first thing that comes to mind is the word alone. I believe you should experience true silence when you are alone! It means that the silence makes you feel lonely, or that the loneliness makes your surroundings silent? Both are, in my opinion, the cause, but it is dependent on the people and things around you.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>There are two types of people who experience silence when they are alone: The first group is those who experience silence when no one is present to interact with them. This silence made them feel isolated, which was excruciatingly painful. Everyone, I believe, has been in this situation at some point in their lives.Those who have not experienced this are truly blessed. That is not to say that those who went through it were not blessed. Have you noticed yourself before and after you go silent? I can assure you that you will not be the same person after experiencing this situation. During your silence, you learned a lot. These are the events that have influenced you.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 The second type of person is distinct. When they are surrounded by their favourite things, they experience silence. It could be a specific person or anything. When one of my friends told me about his experience with me, I was deeply hurt. He just started saying, "I am one of the thousands of people standing in a random crowd of them. I've just noticed she's among them. Then I got butterflies in my stomach. My entire environment has become a movie frame. Except for her, everything blurs! Everyone had frozen, and she was lost in my imagination. She feels fascinated by everything around her. I've been staring at her for as long as I can remember, but she hasn't noticed me. At that moment, I feel surrounded by silence, which makes me feel complete and special." I became stunned as he said it. I've noticed his expression as he expresses it. It appears to be something that cannot be explained.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <p>
                                 Have you ever noticed someone in your group who secretly loves someone? Have you ever noticed how consistent they are? Have you ever noticed how quiet they were when their loved one was nearby? They are in their fantasy world, savouring every moment with their beloved. They haven't spoken to each other in a long time. They haven't always had a verbal conversation. They usually communicate through their eyes. These things may cause us to sigh when we hear them. But these are real things. I've noticed people like Arun admiring at the beauty of Nithiya. They only communicate with their eyes. These discussions meant a lot . Their expressions were priceless as they looked at each other. The crucial point was that most of them had not expressed their feelings to one another. But their bond was unique. They've spent more time talking about each other than they have with each other. Their bond is something to cherish.
                                 </p>
                             <br>
                             <p>Have you ever remained silent during a difficult time? These silences cause you to think differently, to suffer, and to heal. Everyone of us must want to feel the silence around us in order to be aware of it. You can feel the pain and value of being alone in your silence as the person who was surrounded by the most talkative people. This silence teaches you about yourself. This silence can sometimes make everyone feel complete.Enjoy and make use of every silence you suppose to!</p>
